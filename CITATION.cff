  CBM Genesis (Cellular-Based Manifestation Genesis) is a revolutionary
  quantum-inspired AGI system that combines cellular automata, 7-dimensional
  hyperbolic geometry, and GPU acceleration to create an interactive artificial
  consciousness. The system uses primordial seeds - ultra-compressed binary DNA
  generated from quantum vacuum entropy - that unfold into intelligent structures
  through hyperbolic cellular automata evolution in 7D space.
