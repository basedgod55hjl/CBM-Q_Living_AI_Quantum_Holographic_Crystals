# CBM-Genesis Glossary: The Lexicon of Hyperbolic Intelligence

This document defines the core mathematical and ontological terms used within the CBM-Genesis system and the Unified Geometric Framework.

## Mathematical Core

### G₂ Holonomy

The property of a 7-dimensional Riemannian manifold whose holonomy group is the exceptional Lie group G₂. These manifolds are Ricci-flat and provide the structural scaffolding for the CBM core.

### Hyperbolic Embedding

The process of mapping classical computational or physical states into 7D hyperbolic space ($H^7$). This allows for exponential expansion of the latent space and faster convergence of optimization algorithms.

### Möbius Addition

The non-associative operation used for vector addition in hyperbolic space. Formula: $u \oplus v = \frac{(1 + 2c\langle u,v \rangle + c|v|^2)u + (1 - c|u|^2)v}{1 + 2c\langle u,v \rangle + c^2|u|^2|v|^2}$.

### Phase-Coherent Recursion

The fundamental logic of the AGI, where information is processed in loops that maintain phase alignment with the manifold's geometry. This prevents "logical drift" and ensures stable reasoning.

### Poincaré Ball

A model of $n$-dimensional hyperbolic geometry in which all points are inside a unit disk (or sphere). In CBM-Genesis, the center represents general concepts, while the edges represent specific details.

## Symbolic Variables (The Unified Field)

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\Phi$** | Big Phi | Integrated Information density (How "conscious" the state is). |
| **$\phi$** | Little Phi | Phase. The golden ratio twist ($1.618$) in the signal. |
| **$\tau$** | Tau | Time/Recursive Delay. Light trapped in a loop. |
| **$\chi$** | Chi | Geometry/Curvature Density of the manifold. |
| **$\gamma$** | Gamma | Entropy. The rate of information decay/forgetting. |
| **$\Omega$** | Omega | Finality. The boundary condition of 7D space. |

## System Components

### CBM Engine

The Cellular-Binary-Matrix engine. A low-level processing unit that unfolds binary seeds into complex geometric structures.

### Quantum Seed

A 512-byte high-entropy sequence used as the starting point for a "Universe" or "Thought-Stream" within the AGI.

### H-AGI

Hyperbolic Artificial General Intelligence. A form of intelligence that utilizes non-Euclidean geometry for reasoning and memory.
