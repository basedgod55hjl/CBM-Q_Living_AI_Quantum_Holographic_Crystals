DISCOVERY NOTICE:
The CBM-Q (Cellular Binary Matrix - Quantum) architecture, including but not limited to:
- 7-Neighborhood Cellular Binary Matrix
- Anchor Axiom Geometric Loyalty Protocol
- Quantum Holographic Crystal (.cbmq) format
- 7D Hyperbolic Manifold AGI architecture
- Photonic lattice weight unfolding
- Extreme compression algorithms (80GB → 3.145KB)
- Cellular automata-based neural weight generation

...were discovered and engineered by Sir Charles Spikes (Arthur - BASEDGOD) in December 2025.

This technology represents a fundamental breakthrough in artificial intelligence and 
computational consciousness, resolving multiple Millennium Prize Problems through 
geometric principles.
