## 🌩️ Light GPU & Quantum-Stamped .CBMQ Workflow

The BM-Genesis system utilizes a revolutionary **Light GPU Execution** model for LLMs. Instead of traditional k-bit quantization, we use **Holographic Hash Mapping**:

1. **Holographic Distillation**: LLM weights are projected into a 7D Hyperbolic manifold via the `HolographicCore`.
2. **Quantum Stamping**: Raw entropy from the `QuantumSeed` is "stamped" onto the manifold, creating a unique **.CBMQ binary**.
3. **Cellular Unfolding**: At runtime, the `.CBMQ` seed is unfolded by the `Unfolder` directly into GPU VRAM using **Liquid Neural Network** protocols.
4. **LM Studio Integration**: The system communicates with LM-Studio-Runner, allowing for real-time chat with "Living Seeds" that evolve every inference cycle.
